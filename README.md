# PicturesApp

## Description:

We are creating a frontend app that allows staff to manage web site content. on the web site.
One of the features that needs to be implemented is managing images with tooltips.

Admin can upload images and add special pointer to it. When user hovers this pointer, tooltip appears. Tooltip text is customizable by admin.

We need to create a tool for admin to manage images with tooltips.
Admin should be able to see list of images, add image, edit image, delete image. Also with adding or editing images he can add or edit tooltips pointer. Also we need to have a preview mode to test image with tooltip to see how it works for a common user.

## Requirements:

You should use one of the modern js frameworks
It is necessary to emulate server interactions. All responses have to be stubbed. But please keep in mind that it should be possible to unstub it fast and to change it for real requests.
Markup should be simple but adaptive for mobile devices.
You should create custom functionality for handling tooltips on images, and not use already existing solutions.

Before implementing your solutions, provide an estimation and the list of technologies that you are going to use.

## Technologies:

- Angular4+ with CLI

## //

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
